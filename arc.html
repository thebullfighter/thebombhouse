        <h3>Development of ARC</h3>
        <p>In the industrial area of Copenhagen, The old Amager Resource
          Centre was the most significant building in the area. Through the
          years it slowly became a well known place for various extreme sports.
          The old ARC building housed four furnace lines and was quite out of
          date. The proposal was brought forth to five Danish municipalities
          who would not only improve the environment but also showcase Danish
          innovative technology.</p> <a href="http://www.big.dk/#projects-arc">ref</a>

        <h3>Defining ARC</h3>
        <p>Construction of the new “Amager Resource Centre” (ARC) began in 2013.
        Prior to this, the old resource center was the most significant building
        in the area which was also home to all manner of Extreme Sports. In need
        of renewal, the proposal was a new Waste-to-Energy plant that is Economically,
        Environmentally and Socially profitable. The goal was to increase the
        relationship between the structure and the city by expanding the areas
        activities and turning the roof of the new ARC building into a ski slope.
        Since its completion the plant converts waste into power for 62,500 homes
        and hot water for 160,000 homes. It cuts C02 emissions by 100,000 tonnes.
        The plant produces more clean water than it uses. Because of its filtration
        and other technologies, sulphur is expected to  be reduced by 99.5% and
        Nitrogen Oxide by 90%. The special feature of the plant is its chimney
        which does NOT emit its exhaust continually, but instead “smoke rings”
        that consist of water vapour rather than actual smoke making it environmentally
        friendly. ARC doubles as an extreme sport destination for thrill seekers,
        Cable wakeboarding, skiing and rock climbing. In an interview with
        Bjarke Ingels, he has also stated that Copenhagen is a relatively flat
        city, with the introduction of ARC, it has also changed the topology of
        the area. </p><a href="http://www.big.dk/#projects-arc">ref</a>

        <h3>For and Against</h3>
        <p>Already being a country that is well ahead of the curve in the
        sustainability side of things, Five of the surrounding Danish
        municipalities all signed up for ownership of the ARC. There wasn't
        much of an against argument but more of a disbelief that the project
        would not be able to see the light of day. The plant opened March 2017.</p>

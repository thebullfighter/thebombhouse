<h1>Urban Transformation</h1>
<p>My team mate is Ebony Pritchard</p>

<p>CODE1230<br><br>
Urban Transformation is a large scale project that intentionally
transforms a location giving it the ability to add value to an area.
Urban transformation takes into consideration climate change,
demographics, sustainability, how the space will be used and
potentially other factors.

<h2>The Development of Barangaroo</h2>
<img src="diagramascending.png" alt="image missing" width="128" height="128"/>
<p>Barangaroo is defined as  a “large-scale urban development”(http://www.barangaroo.com/home.aspx)
Over half of the sector will be filled with public spaces, and a continuation
 of Sydney Harbour promenade, expansive parklands, plazas and coves.
 (https://www.barangaroo.com/the-project/progress/barangaroo-development/)
 Open Spaces for the public. A new water area will cover 50% of the 22 hectare
 site. (http://www.barangaroo.com/home.aspx)</p>
 
 <h2>Echo</h2>

 <p>A complete transformation of the location. It is divided into three precincts,
  Barangaroo South, Central and Reserve. The south is dedicated for the financial
  services and include apartments, a major hotel, shops, cafes, restaurants and
  cultural spaces.(http://www.barangaroo.com/home.aspx) A link dedicated to foot
  traffic will connect Barangaroo South with public transport at Wynyard and the
  city centre, thus making the area accessible. Barangaroo Central is endeavoured
  to create networks between commercial and community spaces and the Barangaroo
  Reserve is dedicated into becoming a  “new destination” to enjoy the scenery
  of Sydney Harbour. (http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/vision/changing-urban-precincts/barangaroo)</p>
 
<h2>Integrated</h2>
 <img src="diagramintegrated.png" alt="image missing" width="128" height="128"/>
 <p>It is projected to support 23,000 permanent jobs, home 3,500 residents and add
  $2 billion revenue to the New South Wales economy (https://www.barangaroo.com/the-project/progress/barangaroo-development/)
 Barangaroo is aimed to be Australia’s first large scale carbon neutral community,
  capable of being water positive and targeting zero net waste to landfill by 2020.
  Reducing the Co2 emission reduces the impact on the environment and climate change
  as a result.

 <h2>Landscape</h2>
 <img src="diagramlandscape.png" alt="image missing" width="128" height="128"/>
 <p>The integration of buildings and the built space, allowing space for people to live, interact and work
Echoing in the stylistic choices of the main structures within Barangaroo, and having visually interesting buildings
Pathways that follow a flowing course, weaving through foliage and twisting and turning, to allow for an explorative experience
Complete change of the landscape, from a flat concrete port, to a natural reserve with an interesting topography
The reserve and the aim be a more ‘green’ space, and be the first large scale carbon neutral community in Australia

 <h2>Naturalistic</h2>

 <p>Success of Barangaroo:

The integration of buildings and the built space, allowing space for people to live, interact and work 

By the end of June there were more than 50 bars and restaurants opened in the retail and dining precinct. (https://www.barangaroo.com/the-project/progress/timeline/)

It is the plants that are the standout feature. The species selection is meticulous and botanically expansive. There are over 70,000 plants in total, with some never before used in a horticultural setting. Stuart Pittendrigh, responsible for the planting, remarks that the “growth rates have been spectacular” and less than 1% of specimens have been lost during their establishment. These outstanding growth rates can largely be attributed to a rigorous technical approach to phosphorous, pH and permeability or drainage, established by soil specialist Simon Leake.

        <h3>Development of Barangaroo</h3>
        <p>Barangaroo is currently under development with a current
          goal to be fully completed and developed by 2024. It was
          formerly known as Darling Harbour east, located along the
          harbour between King Street Wharf and Walsh Bay and unlike
          what it looks like today, Barangaroo succumbed to the 1960s
          the shipping container revolution which created a vast,
          featureless concrete apron, obliterating the original
          topography of the landscape.
          <a href="https://www.barangaroo.com/see-and-do/the-stories/maritime-history/">(ref)</a>
          As technology advanced into the 21st century, the area was
          unable to adapt thus unsustainable. The NSW Government
          decided to redeveloped the area in 2003, into a new urban
          precinct and is currently supervised by the New South Wales
          state government. <a href="http://www.barangaroo.com/home.aspx">(ref)</a></p>

        <h3>Defining Barangaroo</h3>
        <p>Barangaroo is defined as  a “large-scale urban development”
          <a href="http://www.barangaroo.com/home.aspx">(ref)</a>
          Over half of the sector will be filled with public spaces,
          and a continuation of Sydney Harbour promenade, expansive
          parklands, plazas and coves.
          <a href="https://www.barangaroo.com/the-project/progress/barangaroo-development/">(ref)</a>
          Open Spaces for the public. A new water area will cover 50%
          of the 22 hectare site. <a href="http://www.barangaroo.com/home.aspx">(ref)</a>
          A complete transformation of the location. It is divided into
          three precincts, Barangaroo South, Central and Reserve.
          The south is dedicated for the financial services and include
          apartments, a major hotel, shops, cafes, restaurants and
          cultural spaces. <a href="http://www.barangaroo.com/home.aspx">(ref)</a>
          A link dedicated to foot traffic will connect Barangaroo South
          with public transport at Wynyard and the city centre, thus making
          the area accessible. Barangaroo Central is endeavoured to create
          networks between commercial and community spaces and the
          Barangaroo Reserve is dedicated into becoming a  “new destination”
          to enjoy the scenery of Sydney Harbour.
          <a href="http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/vision/changing-urban-precincts/barangaroo">(ref)</a>
          It is projected to support 23,000 permanent jobs, home 3,500 residents
          and add $2 billion revenue to the New South Wales economy
          <a href="https://www.barangaroo.com/the-project/progress/barangaroo-development/">(ref)</a>
          Barangaroo is aimed to be Australia’s first large scale carbon neutral
          community, capable of being water positive and targeting zero net
          waste to landfill by 2020. Reducing the Co2 emission reduces the
          impact on the environment and climate change as a result.

        <h3>The Arguments</h3>
        <p>There was no real argument against the Barangaroo redevelopment,
          as the space before was outdated, and not used effectively.
          The NSW Government decided to turn the featureless landscape into
          a new thriving area. The main controversy revolves around the still
          in development, Barangaroo South. The area is aimed to contain many
          new and innovative buildings, the most prominent being the Crown
          Casino. The structure is aimed to be one of sydney's highest buildings,
          and also the first 6 star rated hotel in sydney. In 2016, there was a
          legal challenge from a community group, as there was an objection to
          the construction of the casino, as the land previously reserved for
          parklands.
          <a href="https://www.news.com.au/finance/business/breaking-news/crown-sues-over-bridge-opera-house-views/news-story/dbfe85c132e33d13d613a85f0f6bba83">(ref)</a>
          However, recently Crown Resorts has filed a lawsuit to stop the NSW
          government from approving developments that obstruct views of the
          Sydney Opera House and Harbour Bridge from its new Barangaroo hotel
          and casino. Lendlease have also taken legal action, as it affects some
          of their apartments as well. However, the Barangaroo Delivery Authority
          have been acting within their contractual obligations, and have negotiated
          with the Crown and Lendlease for 28 months.</p>

<p>Construction of the new “Amager Resource Centre” (ARC) began in 2013. Prior to this,
 the old resource center was the most significant building in the area which was also
 home to all manner of Extreme Sports. In need of renewal, the proposal was a new Waste-to-Energy
 plant that is Economically, Environmentally and Socially profitable. The goal was to increase
 the relationship between the structure and the city by expanding the areas activities and turning
 the roof of the new ARC building into a ski slope. (http://www.big.dk/#projects-arc)</p>

 <p>ARC: Waste Management. The plant converts waste into power for 62,500 homes and hot water for
  160,000 homes. It cuts C02 emissions by 100,000 tonnes. The plant produces more clean water than
  it uses. Because of its filtration and other technologies, sulphur is expected to  be reduced by
  99.5% and Nitrogen Oxide by 90% (so what?). The special feature of the plant is its chimney which
  does NOT emit its exhaust continually, but instead “smoke rings” that consist of water vapour
  rather than actual smoke. (expand on how its beneficial m8). ARC doubles as an extreme sport
  destination for thrill seekers, Cable wakeboarding, skiing and rock climbing. In an interview
  with Bjarke Ingels, he has also stated that Copenhagen is a relatively flat city, with the
  introduction of ARC, it has also changed the topology of the area. (so what? Explain means to
  show “Cause → Effect”)</p>
